Cloud services and encryption is an area that is currently recieving more attention. Several services for cloud storage exist that emphasize security. Spider Oak \cite{spideroak} is a file hosting and sync service that encrypts all files locally on the client machine before syncing with cloud storage. Viivo \cite{viivo} is a program which integrates with the popular cloud hosting service Dropbox \cite{dropbox}, and claims to encrypt files before they hit the cloud. Cloudfogger \cite{cloudfogger} is a service similar to Viivo.

The AWS SDK for Java \cite{aws-sdk-java} is another programming focused library, similar to boto. This SDK does currently support client-side encryption for S3.

Charles Leifer has created a client-side encryption implementation for Amazon S3 and the Flask Python framework \cite{flask}.
