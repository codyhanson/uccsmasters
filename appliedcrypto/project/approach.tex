\section{Proposed Approach}

My proposed approach is to modify boto Python library to add support for AES256 local encryption. 
This addition will be an extra option that the developer can choose to use while using boto, and if client-side encryption
is invoked, it will happen transparently upon file upload and download to the users machine. Encryption will be performed
using a key specified by the user, and will never be stored in the cloud.
