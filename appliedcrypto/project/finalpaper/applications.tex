\section{Potential Applications}

Enabling easy to use client side encryption in these S3 libraries (and other cloud's as well) is crucial to advancing the adoption of cloud technologies as 
the stakes for losing data grow larger. Often users of cloud technologies are not extremely knowledgable about different security practices,
so lowering the barrier to entry for them to create secure applications is important. 

The main limitation of using symmetric encryption on files in the cloud is key management. If you wanted EC2 machines to be able to read your encrypted
S3 data, you would need to distribute the keys to those machines, which themselves are in the cloud. I think a next logica step for cloud security is to
guarantee that the virtual machines are non-malicous, and that plaintext data being processed by the machines can be trusted as not being compromised.
